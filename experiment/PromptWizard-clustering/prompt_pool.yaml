  - "What is the targeted output that I should produce?"
  - "How many instances of the output should I produce?"
  - "How could I ensure that the output is correct and complete with the expected number of response?"
  - "How can I break down this problem into smaller pieces so that the response format is guaranteed to be correct?"
  - "Try creative thinking, allocating instances into clusters one-by-one can lead to a complete list of labels with all instances covered."
  - "Clustering takes n sentences instances as input and produce n label instances as output, which is the golden rule."
  - "Omission error happens when the response contains less or more label instances than the input instrances, which is strictly forbidden."
  - "What is the best way to allocate instances into clusters to ensure that the output is correct and complete?"
  - "How can I ensure that the output is consistent with the input instances?"
  - "What are the potential errors or mistakes that could occur in producing the output?"
  - "How can I avoid these errors and ensure that the output is accurate and reliable?"
  - "What are the key assumptions underlying this task?"
  - "How can progress or success in solving the problem be measured or evaluated?"
  - "Optimization target: obtain the exact same amount of instances in the output as in the input."
  - "Clustering target: allocate instances into clusters to ensure that all instances are covered, and the cluster maintains high coherence."
  - "Tip: allocating too many instrances to one cluster is not ideal, as it may lead to a lack of diversity in the clusters."
  - "Tip: all clusters should have some instances allocated to them, to ensure that all instances are covered."
  - "Rule: make sure the output contains the exact amount of instances as the input."
  - "Does the problem require addressing systemic or structural issues rather than just individual instances?"
  - "Is the problem time-sensitive or urgent, requiring immediate attention and action?"
  - "What kinds of solution typically are produced for this kind of problem specification?"
  - "Given the problem specification and the current best solution, have a guess about other possible solutions."
  - "Let's imagine the current best solution is totally wrong, what other ways are there to think about the problem specification?"
  - "What is the best way to modify this current best solution, given what you know about these kinds of problem specification?"
  - "Ignoring the current best solution, create an entirely new solution to the problem."
  - "Let's think step by step."
  - "Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation."

  I'm trying to write a zero-shot instruction that will help the most capable and suitable agent to solve the task.
  My current prompt is: "{instruction}"
  But this prompt gets the following examples wrong: Omission error: number of instances in the ouput does not correspond to the number of input instances; {examples}
  Provide detail feedback which identifies reasons where the instruction could have gone wrong.
  Wrap each reason with <START> and <END>

  I'm trying to write a prompt for zero-shot instruction task that will help the most capable and suitable agent to solve the task.
  My current prompt is:
  [CURRENT PROMPT] "{instruction}"
  Now this prompt got the following examples correct:
  [CORRECT EXAMPLES] {examples}
  Since you cant use these examples, analyse and understand characteristics/complexity and diversity of these examples and their reasoning chain and
  accordingly provide suggestions to further improve the prompt and make it better as a zero shot instruction task.

  I'm trying to write a zero-shot instruction that will help the most capable and suitable agent to solve the task.
  My current prompt is: "{instruction}"
  But this prompt gets the following examples wrong: Omission error: number of instances in the ouput does not correspond to the number of input instances; {examples}
  On carefully analysing these examples, following are the critiques related to prompt {critique}
  Use the critique smartly, refine the current prompt to make sure we dont get these examples wrong and ensure the output contains exactly the same number of instances as the input.
  Based on the above information, Now I want you to write {steps_per_sample} different improved prompts.
  Each prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.
